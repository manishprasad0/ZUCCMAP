# ZUCCMAP

ZUCCMAP is an acronym for Zurich Undergraduate Colloquium in Computational Science, Mathematics And Physics and is part of VMP (Verein der Mathematik-, Physik- und RW-Studierenden an der ETH).
I gave a presentation on Gravitational Waves in this colloquium. This repository contains the code for the animations I used in my presentation.
